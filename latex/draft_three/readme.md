### To-Do

	* Review table 2: are we still using these terms?
	* Review table 3: does the reader need to know about these attributes?
	* Review table 4: 
		* are we using a census dataset?
		* are where is the hamilton_county_property data from? city-data? http://www.city-data.com/nbmaps/neigh-Cincinnati-Ohio.html
		
	* Do table descriptions have periods like full sentences? Look at table 6 - Zillow
	* Compare and update Table 1 with new table from National Safety Council:
		# ...   Death           $10,082,000
		# ...   Disabling       $1,103,000
		# ...   Evident         $304,000
		# ...   Possible injury $141,000
		# ...   No injuryobserved $46,600
	* Determine methodology for designating image heights
	
	
	
	
	
	* Check: Joshua removed \FloatBarrier s before and after the % that divides Tabels 5. and 6. (Opendata and Supplementary). Make sure this isn't a bone-head move.
