My kids and I use this crosswalk multiple times every school day to get to Hyde Park School. They have grown used to not having vehicles stop here for us to cross. This morning myself and another adult were crossing with my daughter. As there was no westbound traffic we entered the crosswalk and watched as 3 cars passed by without stopping while we were just a step from the yellow center stripe. My daughter took a small step forward and the forth car swerved toward the curb instead of stopping to let us pass. The fifth car finally stopped but it shouldn��?t have gotten that far. The swerve had scared my daughter I tears and I had to carry her the rest of the way home. At the least one of the signs in the middle of the road should be placed at this crosswalk similar to what is at observatory and Michigan. ,08/05/2018 00:00:00,08:25:00,2838 OBSERVATORY AV CINC - GJ2149835153,2838 OBSERVATORY AV,HYDE PARK,50,STANDARD,INTERNET,4000060041,08/05/2018 00:00:00,MOBILE,09/05/2018 00:00:00,,08/05/2018 00:00:00,08/05/2018 00:00:00,,1419060,420156,0,2838,  ,OBSERVATORY AV                  ,DOTE,,2842,DOTE-DEFAULT

I was driving south on Madison just past the Skyline in the right-most lane. As I approached and entered the crosswalk I noticed two men in the crosswalk in the parking lane waiting for cars to stop so they could safely cross the street. As I began to continue driving south I suddenly heard a screech of brakes then the sound of a car being rear-ended followed by a woman's screaming. My first thought is that one of the men had been hit but I glanced over my shoulder and they appeared to be OK.  12) Please provide any additional information that may help us serve you. I think what happened is that a car saw the men noticed they were in a crosswalk and they should stop to allow them to cross and stopped suddenly. This caused the car behind them to rear-end them.On a separate note this is one reason why I would love to see the city adapt H.A.W.K. lights for mid-block crosswalks. I have seen these in action in Portland/Vancouver WA area and they work great because they actually require drivers to stop when a pedestrian is in the intersection ,04/05/2018 00:00:00,13:08:00,3074 MADISON RD CINC - GJ2195436855,3074 MADISON RD,OAKLEY,53,STANDARD,INTERNET,5000010024,04/05/2018 00:00:00,CCSRWEB,05/05/2018 00:00:00,,04/05/2018 00:00:00,04/05/2018 00:00:00,,1420863,425570,0,3074,  ,MADISON RD                      ,DOTE,,2842,DOTE-DEFAULT

I was half way through and a car in the lane closest to the middle was slowing down and had put his flashers on. I started across but the car in the lane next to the curb did not stop and kept on through the crosswalk. The next car did slow down and let me through.  12) Please provide any additional information that may help us serve you. It seems that this cross walk is fairly dangerous. If we make it through the north flowing traffic then many times we have to wait in the middle of the busy street for the south flowing traffic to lighten up or stop. I wish that the cross walk sign had lights and both sides of the striping on the pavement had flashing lights that could be triggered to light up when someone wanted to cross to give traffic a fair warning to slow down. I have had many times where traffic would not yield to the pedestrians.

SR18006490,CLOSED  ,Pedestrian Incident Report,Request entered through the Web. Refer to Intake Questions for further description. 1) What was the date when the incident occurred? The crosswalk is in a bend in the road and the pedestrian cannot see what is coming from the right because of parked cars at the meters.  When you get into the middle of the crosswalk cars are coming too fast and don't stop for the pedestrian's safe  passage.  Often times it's speeding vehicles.  2) What was the time of day when the incident occurred? In the AM between 8:00am and 8:30 am  3) What was the type of incident? Close call  4) Which street were you crossing? Albert Sabin Way  5) What direction were you headed? South  6) Were you in a crosswalk when the incident occurred?

Turning left  10) Did you report the incident to the Cincinnati Police? No  11) Describe the incident as specifically as possible. Every morning I have to cross at this particular crosswalk and it's very stressful because people are in a hurried frenzy and 1. are speeding and don't stop or 2. are ignorant of the traffic law that pedestrians have the right of way.  I have near misses too many times.  I get to the center of the crosswalk and cars just keep moving. Frightening.  12) Please provide any additional information that may help us serve you. Please may there be flashing yellow lights particularly in the morning and in the afternoon between 4:30 and 5:30 when it's most dangerous.  At Bethesda North Hospital there are yellow lights that flash when the pedestrian walks up to the curb to cross at their crosswalk.

Any time you try to cross the street to get to your vehicle (only street parking available for most residents) you are in danger of cars and heavy pickup trucks that are driving incredibly fast up and down Camberwell Road.  These vehicles do not intend to slow down and will come close to hitting you unless you are very aware of their presence.  There is no crosswalk on the street in order for pedestrians to safely cross and for traffic to slow down.  12) Please provide any additional information that may help us serve you. The entirety of Camberwell Road needs to have speed umps in place so to help the speed at which drivers fly down the road.  This especially pertains to heavy pickup trucks (connected to a local landscaping business that operates from their Camberwell location) as they do not obey any speed limit and quickly zoom up and down the street usually towing heavy materials.

There needs to be a crosswalk across Eastern Avenue and McCullough streets. This is extremely dangerous considering the new brewery has brought a lot more street traffic to the area.

I am publicly sharing my massive concern for the area surrounding PRM that someone is going to be hit in their car or on foot. We have a perfect storm now: parked busses narrowing the 2-lanes of Montgomery Rd down to one right after a light cars dropping kids off in the street frustrated drivers speeding through the school zone in anger drivers running red lights and cars exiting from the back of the school with a major blind spot to oncoming cars and crossing pedestrians.We desperately need flashing lights coming into the school zone on all ends a crossing guard with a stop sign at the exit of drop off onto Montgomery (ideally police assistance) and tickets being given to those who speed through and drop kids at the curb.Does it really take someone being injured or killed to get movement on this? Similar situation where my mom lives in Columbus and a mother was t-boned and killed. Only then did they put in a light and address the issue.Our area will only become more congested and it feels like its getting worse every day. ,29/08/2017 00:00:00,09:59:00,6010 MONTGOMERY RD CINC - GJ2191339980,6010 MONTGOMERY RD,PLEASANT RIDGE,"57,01",STANDARD,INTERNET,12200040059,29/08/2017 00:00:00,CCSRWEB,30/08/2017 00:00:00,,29/08/2017 00:00:00,29/08/2017 00:00:00,,1421062,436049,0,6010,  ,MONTGOMERY RD                   ,DOTE,,2842,DOTE-DEFAULT

When we were about half-way through the cross walk I looked over my shoulder and saw a car turning left onto Edwards right in front of us. I stopped but the other parents didn't see the car and kept walking. I yelled at them to stop and the car had to turn wide and close to the Edwards sidewalk (in front of Cock and Bull) to avoid hitting us.  12) Please provide any additional information that may help us serve you.

This deals with the Fire Hydrants (FH) from WInton Rd. North on Gray Rd. up to the hilly part and b ends. The general conditions of the FH's are aging rusting thru the joints like my water at the house.  They should be repainted (regularly programmed).  I'm told that since the caps are yellow meaning that the pressure is under 100.  (Black being over 100?)  A FH or two seem too low to the ground but because of the grass being too high that's not easily discernible. The bottom line is that they need to be addressed.  The roadway seems to be up-to-date but for rain days seem like the road carries a lot of water from various places deteriorating faster the pavement??  Hmm.  Hydrant spacing was not addressed.

My wife and I were walking our infant son and we were crossing from Awakenings Coffee to the center of the square - the cop had his lights OFF (not even his daytime siren lights were on as they are supposed to be) and the cop blew by us when he had plenty of time to stop and I as in the intersection.  That same cop then blew by me again as I was on the other side of the square now crossing to the fire station!  I yelled at him along with another woman who yelled at him from the further west crosswalk and he didn't do anything except speed away lights off.  NOT EVEN OUR OWN POLICE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW A CROSSWALK WORKS.  PEOPLE JUST DON'T KNOW ANYMORE AND YOU NEED TO DO MORE BEFORE SOMEBODY GETS KILLED.

We need and expect more from our city - nobody is even taught how crosswalks work anymore and I haven't seen a cop in 30+ years who actually tickets people for failing to yield.  I beg every month at neighborhood council meetings for cops to actually ticket people but District 2 refuses to do it.  As an alternative can a pedestrian hold out a 2x4 into oncoming traffic to indicate they would like cars to yield to them in a crosswalk?

My six year old son and I were crossing Observatory southbound after school. A crossing guard was on the opposite side of the street. After he entered the crosswalk with bright vest and stop sign my son and I entered the crosswalk from the opposite side of the street. A black car traveling eastbound stopped right away. Off in the distance a white car with Kentucky plates was traveling westbound. I thought that the car would have seen us but as the speeding car neared I saw the female drive with face down and cell phone in hand. She didn't slow until making it to the intersection with the northern crossing of Monteith Avenue and she had to slam on the brakes to avoid crossing into the crosswalk. She shook her head at us as if we were in the wrong for crossing the street but I instructed her that it is state law to stop anytime someone is in a crosswalk.  12) Please provide any additional information that may help us serve you. Is there any additional signage that can be added to this crosswalk? Flashing lights sign indicating that it is state law to stop for pedestrians in crosswalk? ,25/04/2017 00:00:00,11:23:00,2838 OBSERVATORY AV CINC - GJ2149835153,2838 OBSERVATORY AV,HYDE PARK,50,STANDARD,INTERNET,4000060041,25/04/2017 00:00:00,CCSRWEB,26/04/2017 00:00:00,,25/04/2017 00:00:00,25/04/2017 00:00:00,,1419052,420094,0,2838,  ,OBSERVATORY AV                  ,DOTE,,2842,DOTE-DEFAULT

I waited until the left turn arrow for southbound traffic turning from Montgomery onto Ridge ended and I had the Walk light. While half-way through the intersection a car nearly hit me. The woman stopped and yelled at me I almost hit you! I answered back -- Yes you did -- and I had the Walk sign at least when I entered the intersection!  12) Please provide any additional information that may help us serve you. Near-miss was witnessed by people sitting at the window of nearby Nine Giant Brewery who stopped me as I continued my walk home. We commiserated about how frequently these near misses happen in our neighborhood. I spoke at PG Sittenfeld's February meeting on traffic safety and work with Mackenzie Low on a Traffic Committee for PRCC called Pleasant Streets. We have been trying to work with Traffic Engineering on getting some improvements to the neighborhood. One of the low-cost efforts identified is re-painting the crosswalks at major intersections such as the one I was nearly hit at and others. I know the city has many priorities but what can we do to make at the very least getting the crosswalks at this busy intersection re-painted and if possible raised or otherwise made more noticeable? ,19/04/2017 00:00:00,07:29:00,RIDGE AV & MONTGOMERY RD,6099 MONTGOMERY RD,PLEASANT RIDGE,"57,01",STANDARD,INTERNET,12200040040,19/04/2017 00:00:00,CCSRWEB,20/04/2017 00:00:00,,19/04/2017 00:00:00,19/04/2017 00:00:00,,1422249,436395,0,6099,  ,MONTGOMERY RD                   ,DOTE,,2842,DOTE-DEFAULT

The cars in the lane closest to me had stopped to allow me to cross and while I was in the middle of the street a car approaching in the farther lane was speeding and began honking their car while approaching the crosswalk. I was startled and threw my coffee up which subsequently landed on the hood of the approaching car. Apparently I did something wrong here and the driver parked her car and she and her passenger quickly got out of the car. They got in my personal space wielding an umbrella as a weapon verbally and physically threatening me screamed racial slurs at me (��?white bitch��? etc etc) and followed me as I tried to walk away. This was quite a scene and I��?m sure other people saw or at least heard the incident. Security from the ED must of heard because he started to walk towards us. The women got back into their car and left. I waved at the ED security guard to explain the situation but he seemed to think the situation was resolved. Maybe he didn��?t see me but I was surprised that he walked away without talking to me.  12) Please provide any additional information that may help us serve you. I am attending the Round Table discussion with CEO Michael Fisher to discuss this.

Cars zooming around stopped cars are a huge problem both here and in the crosswalks all over hyde park square - even if somebody DOES stop for you which is rare there are people behind them that cannot see you (because you are crossing in front of a car in front of them) and they just pull around and fly forward and you essentially have to wait in front of one lane of stopped traffic until another car in the second lane stops the pull-around traffic in the other lane before you can fully cross the crosswalk safely. ,15/03/2017 00:00:00,08:35:00,2741 OBSERVATORY AV CINC - GJ2112835122,2741 OBSERVATORY AV,HYDE PARK,49,STANDARD,INTERNET,4600050002,15/03/2017 00:00:00,CCSRWEB,16/03/2017 00:00:00,,15/03/2017 00:00:00,15/03/2017 00:00:00,,1417845,420117,0,2741,  ,OBSERVATORY AV                  ,DOTE,,2842,DOTE-DEFAULT

We were at the crosswalk and he had ample time to stop but he was going about 40mph because it took him about 40' to stop his car. ,14/03/2017 00:00:00,13:22:00,3021 MADISON RD CINC -,3021 MADISON RD,OAKLEY,52,STANDARD,INTERNET,3900040085,14/03/2017 00:00:00,CCSRWEB,15/03/2017 00:00:00,,14/03/2017 00:00:00,14/03/2017 00:00:00,,1420380,425043,0,3021,  ,MADISON RD                      ,DOTE,,2842,DOTE-DEFAULT

I waited at the cross walk while cars refused to stop for me and eventually I just made my way into the road and was nearly struck by an oncoming car.  Another car came so close to me going west that i actually reached out and banged on a window as it drove by me.  This is the single most unsafe crosswalk in the entire city and somebody it going to get killed soon.  Nobody understands or knows that you must STOP YOUR CAR for people in a crosswalk.  12) Please provide any additional information that may help us serve you. I'm going to take the time to note every instance of a car failing to stop and nearly striking me in this particular crosswalk at Observatory and Michigan and you're going to think I'm just making it up but you could nearly get hit hundreds of times in a single day just trying to walk back and forth on this incredibly dangerous crosswalk.  It does NOT matter that there are blinking lights and neon yellow signs everywhere people simply do not care and REFUSE to stop for anything other than a traffic light.  There has also never once ever in the 30 years I've lived here been a police officer handing our citations for failure to yield to a pedestrian at this (or any) crosswalk in Hyde Park. ,14/03/2017 00:00:00,11:28:00,2741 OBSERVATORY AV CINC - GJ2112835122,2741 OBSERVATORY AV,HYDE PARK,49,STANDARD,INTERNET,4600050002,14/03/2017 00:00:00,CCSRWEB,15/03/2017 00:00:00,,14/03/2017 00:00:00,14/03/2017 00:00:00,,1417845,420117,0,2741,  ,OBSERVATORY AV                  ,DOTE,,2842,DOTE-DEFAULT

There is no sidewalk on langland just north of beechmont. walking north on langland on the east side of the street I have to walk in the street along with the traffic to pick up my child after school. it's really odd that the sidewalk abruptly ends and forces pedestrians (and young children) into the street to wash to our from school. every day I have to walk in the street with all the traffic to pick up my child. please fix immediately.  12) Additional Comments? there are ZERO crosswalks in and around Parker Woods Montessori. not sure why this is. it's a SCHOOL that has hundreds of children walking around. ,13/03/2017 00:00:00,22:25:00,4370 BEECH HILL AV CINC - GJ1284238305,4370 BEECH HILL AV,NORTHSIDE,75,STANDARD,INTERNET,19600240022,13/03/2017 00:00:00,MOBILE,14/03/2017 00:00:00,,13/03/2017 00:00:00,13/03/2017 00:00:00,,1391217,431896,0,4370,  ,BEECH HILL AV                   ,DOTE,,2842,DOTE-DEFAULT
